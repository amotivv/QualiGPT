# QualiGPT - Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The QualiGPT web application is a **fully functional** qualitative data analysis tool that has successfully migrated from a desktop PyQt5 application to a modern web-based interface. The current focus is on documentation and potential enhancements based on user feedback.

## Recent Changes & Current State

### Migration Completed
- **Desktop to Web**: Successfully converted PyQt5 desktop application to Flask web application
- **UI Modernization**: Replaced desktop GUI with responsive HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface
- **Architecture Simplification**: Moved from stateful desktop app to stateless web service
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Improved workflow with better visual feedback and error handling
- **OpenAI API Migration**: Updated from legacy API (0.27.8) to modern v1.0+ syntax
- **Template Structure**: Fixed Flask template loading with proper templates/ directory

### Current Implementation Status
‚úÖ **Fully Implemented Features**:
- OpenAI API integration with GPT-4o (latest v1.0+ syntax)
- Multi-format file processing (CSV, XLSX, DOCX)
- Three analysis types (Interview, Focus Group, Social Media Posts)
- Intelligent data segmentation for large datasets
- Custom prompt support and role-playing mode
- Structured table output with themes, descriptions, quotes, and participant counts
- CSV and text export functionality
- Responsive web interface with modern styling
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

### File Structure Analysis
The current project has a clean, organized structure:
```
QualiGPT/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ qualigpt-webapp.py          # Main Flask application (fully functional)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ qualigpt-html.html          # Standalone HTML version (alternative interface)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt            # All dependencies specified
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                   # Comprehensive documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ QualiGPTApp.py             # Original desktop version (legacy)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ memory-bank/               # Project documentation (new)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ graph/                     # Project assets and diagrams
```

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### 1. Template Architecture Decision
**Current State**: HTML is embedded within the standalone `qualigpt-html.html` file
**Consideration**: Whether to separate into Flask templates directory
**Decision**: Keep current structure for simplicity and single-file deployment option

### 2. API Version Management
**Current State**: Using OpenAI API v1.0+ (latest version) with GPT-4o
**Consideration**: Completed migration from legacy v0.27.8 to modern syntax
**Decision**: Successfully upgraded to latest API with enhanced capabilities

### 3. Frontend Framework Decision
**Current State**: Vanilla JavaScript implementation
**Consideration**: Whether to introduce React/Vue for more complex interactions
**Decision**: Current vanilla JS approach is sufficient for the application's needs

### 4. Data Persistence Strategy
**Current State**: No data persistence (stateless application)
**Consideration**: Adding optional result saving or user accounts
**Decision**: Maintain stateless design for security and simplicity

## Next Steps & Priorities

### Immediate Actions (Current Session)
